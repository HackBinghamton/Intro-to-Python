# Intro-to-Python

## Installing Python
Download and Install Python at this link:
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

On Mac/Linux, it's likely already installed, or you could use the command line if you're comfortable with it.

## Running Python
### Fast and Easy for Demo Purposes
Go to this website and search for Python as the language:
[https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/)

Or just use the command line on Mac/Linux if you are familiar.

### Slower but better
Install some sort of Python IDE
* IDLE is popular for beginners
	* I think it comes pre-installed with the Python download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) is popular for Data Scientists - It and many other tools come all packaged together with "Anaconda"
